## Exploratory Data Analysis
```{r}
A. Defining the Question

1. Perform clustering stating insights drawn from your analysis and visualizations.
2. Providing comparisons between the approaches learned this week i.e. K-Means clustering vs Hierarchical clustering highlighting the strengths and limitations of each approach in the context of the analysis.
```
```{r}
B. Metrics for Success
                                  1. Plotting Clusters to visualise modelled clusters & noise points
                                  2. Confusion Matrix to measure accuracy
 ``` 
 ```{r}
C. Understanding the Context 

It is imperative that all entrepreneurs identify all opportunities to advertise and boost their sales in whatever business they are engaged in. (See Problem Definition)

                                  3.Check the Data
                                  4.Perform Data Cleaning
                                  5.Perform Exploratory Data Analysis  (Univariate, Bivariate & Multivariate)
                                  6.Implement the Solution using K-means & Hierarchical Clustering Algorithms
                                  7.Challenge the Solution using DBSCAN Algorithm
                                  8.Follow up Questions
