## Exploratory Data Analysis

A. Defining the Question

A Kenyan entrepreneur has created an online cryptography course and would want to advertise it on her blog. She currently targets audiences originating from various countries. In the past, she ran ads to advertise a related course on the same blog and collected data in the process. My task as a Data Science Consultant is to to help her by creating a model that predicts which individuals are most likely to click on her ads

B. Metrics for Success
                                  1. Plotting Clusters to visualise modelled clusters & noise points
                                  2. Confusion Matrix to measure accuracy
                                  
C. Understanding the Context 

It is imperative that all entrepreneurs identify all opportunities to advertise and boost their sales in whatever business they are engaged in. (See Problem Definition)
